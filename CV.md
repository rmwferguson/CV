## Projects

### __A novel framework for predicting emerging chemical stressor impacts in complex ecosystems__

University of Essex (2018-) 

The project will combine modelling, experimental manipulations and monitoring across a range of freshwater ecosystems that provide crucial services to society, from those driven by microbes at the base of the food web (for example, water purification) to those associated with fishes at the top.

### __Rapid Monitoring of Bioaerosols in Urban, Agricultural and Industrial Environments. RAMBIE__
